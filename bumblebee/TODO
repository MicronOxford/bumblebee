* scrap the report action all together?


* db structure:
  - SMALLINT is max 32767. Is this a limitation (e.g. number bookings!)?
  - permit table prefix:
    - billing
    - emaillist
    - specialcosts

* bookings
  - 

* projects
  - 

* costs
  - define what half-day etc is to make billing calcs. <= this is in instrument setup now?

* special costs 
  - todo

* instruments
  - can we put some better validation on the timeslotrule input? e.g. making sure every hour is accounted for?
  
* installer
  - create bumblebee.ini file?
  - can only run once? delete itself?
  - actually do the sql stuff?

* ini file
  - move bumblebee.ini to a db table? 

* adminmenu 
  - ooify?
  
* joindata
  - 

* email lists
  - ooify further

* USER TESTING
  - Firefox
  - IE6
  - Konq
  - IE5.5
  - IE5
  - Safari
  - Netscape 7 OSX

* auth
  -
  
* reporting
  - groups, projects, users using instruments in a period
  - instrument log book 


create a real db with no bogus booking data and no dodgy invalid users etc

include BILLING algorithm:

settings:  numhoursperhalfday = 5, numhoursperfullday=8, halfdaysperday=0.6
a) for a 2 hour booking
b) for a 5 hour booking
c) for a 10 hour booking

numdays = MIN(                                           a)              b)             c)
          numhours / hoursperday,                      2/8    = .25   5/8     = 0.625   10/8    = 1.25
          numhours / hoursperhalfday * halfddaysperday 2/5*.6 = .24   5/5*0.6 = 0.6     10/5*.6 = 1.2
          1                                            1      = 1     1       = 1       1       = 1
        )

        calc'd                                         0.25          0.6                 1
        current                                        0.4           0.6                 1
        


* billing
  - todo
  - incl consumables



document radius install and config

* theme
  - design new theme, bg etc
  - icon location

joindata::_countNumRows counts the rows too early (can we force a recount?)
  => when adding permissions to a user, the number of permissions doesn't increase
      done??????? test this some more
  
* clean up action functions.
  - should groups, projects, users actions etc be invocations of the *same* obj?



->layout switch? use as call back function?

radiolist always returns ischanged on update()

make sure large data structures are being passed by reference not value
(speed up)

reflect postdata in case of re-login
 - when do sessions die?

$string = strip_tags($string, '<a><b><i><u>')
also do this in qw? $string = strip_tags($string, '')


$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']

check for noise in error logs

use redirect header to react to override action= 

hour => halfday => fullday from costs table


permit deletion of instrument classes


escape SQL input for bad characters. esp '. (magic_quotes_gpc solves this?)
escape HTML in output?
  echo "<a href='" . htmlspecialchars("/nextpage.php?stage=23&data=" .
          urlencode($data)) . "'>\n";
      echo "<textarea name='mydata'>\n";
      echo htmlspecialchars($data)."\n";
      echo "</textarea>";

streamline creation of project with only one group
streamline creation of project when creating a user
(projects: create new as option and if set to create new then make one and send the projectid to "edit project")

??  work out confirmation emails and when adminconfirm is necessary

?? create flag for compulsory emails for some events (e.g. booking Raman)

select all/deselect all javascript buttons where applicable

* unbook emails

include consumables and output templating in reporting

billing analysis clean-up procedure... offer each of select groups, projects and users but only where applicable for the billing format in question

clean up user interface

allow templating/skinning of all user interface setup

globally change groups to accounts or bills or something?

* who has used what instruments on what days
* who per month

delete references to groups, projects in billing info, userprojects etc
-- should there be checks for this? cannot delete things if used elsewhere?


show log entries / instrument usage summary


Billing SQL notes:

for billing analysis, write a smart parser that scans the template for keys to write the SQL. May need to do some clever parsing too.

reporting: 
subqueries for "FROM" don't work with current version of MySQL (4.0)
TIMEDIFF and SUBTIME don't work with current MySQL.
maybe use a CREATE...SELECT statement into a temporary table. (how?)
CEIL(x) or CEILING(x) can be used to round up to nearest integer for num hours

Can existing (huge!) expression be used with just variable SELECT (or just select everything?) ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses.

install?
-----------
<?
$dbhost = "localhost";    
$dbusername = "root";     
$dbpass = "";    
$dbname    = "dbname";     
$connection = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbusername, $dbpass);
$SelectedDB = mysql_select_db($dbname);
$filename = "createdb.sql";
$fd = fopen ($filename, "r");
$contents = fread ($fd, filesize ($filename));
fclose ($fd);
mysql_query ("$contents");
?>





LIMITATIONS
===========
no GUI to delete a userclass or instrumentclass 
records are not locked while edited (update is atomic, but last-submitted changes win)

* billing
  - PDF export configured somehow - header, font sizes etc
  - generate reports for combined analysis for distribution
  - generate matrix summary
  - split multiple tables into multiple pdfs


* scrap the report action all together?
* actionbilling??


configure exporttypes from files?

* db structure:
  - SMALLINT is max 32767. Is this a limitation (e.g. number bookings!)?
  - permit table prefix:
    - actionbilling

* instruments
  - can we put some better validation on the timeslotrule input? e.g. making sure every hour is accounted for?
  
* installer
  - create bumblebee.ini file?
  - can only run once? delete itself?
  - actually do the sql stuff?

* ini file
  - move bumblebee.ini to a db table? 

* USER TESTING
  - Firefox
  - IE6
  - Konq
  - IE5.5
  - IE5
  - Safari
  - Netscape 7 OSX



create a real db with no bogus booking data and no dodgy invalid users etc
-> sf.net 


document radius install and config

* theme
  - design new theme, bg etc (not NANO, PFPC, UoM)
  - clean up CSS, images etc for theme
  - icon location

* clean up action functions.
  - should groups, projects, users actions etc be invocations of the *same* obj?



->layout switch? use as call back function?

radiolist always returns ischanged on update()

make sure large data structures are being passed by reference not value
(speed up)

reflect postdata in case of re-login
 - when do sessions die?

$string = strip_tags($string, '<a><b><i><u>')
also do this in qw? $string = strip_tags($string, '')


$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']

check for noise in error logs


permit deletion of instrument classes


streamline creation of project with only one group
streamline creation of project when creating a user
(projects: create new as option and if set to create new then make one and send the projectid to "edit project")

??  work out confirmation emails and when adminconfirm is necessary

?? create flag for compulsory emails for some events (e.g. booking Raman)

select all/deselect all javascript buttons where applicable

* unbook emails

delete references to groups, projects in billing info, userprojects etc
-- should there be checks for this? cannot delete things if used elsewhere?



Billing SQL notes:

for billing analysis, write a smart parser that scans the template for keys to write the SQL. May need to do some clever parsing too.

reporting: 
subqueries for "FROM" don't work with current version of MySQL (4.0)
TIMEDIFF and SUBTIME don't work with current MySQL.
maybe use a CREATE...SELECT statement into a temporary table. (how?)
CEIL(x) or CEILING(x) can be used to round up to nearest integer for num hours




install?
-----------
<?
$dbhost = "localhost";    
$dbusername = "root";     
$dbpass = "";    
$dbname    = "dbname";     
$connection = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbusername, $dbpass);
$SelectedDB = mysql_select_db($dbname);
$filename = "createdb.sql";
$fd = fopen ($filename, "r");
$contents = fread ($fd, filesize ($filename));
fclose ($fd);
mysql_query ("$contents");
?>





LIMITATIONS
===========
no GUI to delete a userclass or instrumentclass 
records are not locked while edited (update is atomic, but last-submitted changes win)

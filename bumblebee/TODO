Billing SQL notes:

for billing analysis, write a smart parser that scans the template for keys to write the SQL. May need to do some clever parsing too.

reporting: 
subqueries for "FROM" don't work with current version of MySQL (4.0)
TIMEDIFF and SUBTIME don't work with current MySQL.
maybe use a CREATE...SELECT statement into a temporary table. (how?)
CEIL(x) or CEILING(x) can be used to round up to nearest integer for num hours

Can existing (huge!) expression be used with just variable SELECT (or just select everything?) ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses.
